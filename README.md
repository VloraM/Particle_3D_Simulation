# 3D Particles Project

This project visualizes 50 particles moving randomly in a 3D space using VPython.  
Particles bounce off the boundaries of a cube of size 10x10x10 units.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- VPython

Install dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to run

python main.py



Features





50 particles with random initial positions and velocities
Real-time animation at 60 frames per second
Particles bounce when hitting the cube boundaries (-5 to 5 on each axis)


Add/Update

*Added create_sphere function for modular creation of particles with configurable number, radius and color. This keeps the orginal movement and reflection behavior unchanged
